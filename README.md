# My-first-portfolio

## Description

* In this project I am showcasing my Avility to recreate a portfolio following a given image to the best of my avility and as close as possible.

* For this specific project I had to create three html pages and a stylesheet.

* In the end I ended up creating the three required html pages, however in order to get them all working I had to used two css stylesheets.

* Since I was trying to recreate a webpage based of an image I did not know how the active parts of the website were supposed to work. whenclicking on the navbar options I did not make them open in a separate tab or window, the page itself just changes to the selected content. I also added a hover option over them for the background color to change to red.

* I have never made a portfolio and so i have no idea what is supposed to be about, in the about me page I just wrote a short paragraph of my last work experience and what I plan on doing next. I am not 100% sure what I was supposed to write. The same with the portfolio page, based on the image provided it had random pictures and words on them. What I did was just add pictured of things I liked and added text describing what the image was.

* Working on this portfolio was a really great experience and I found out that I know more than I thought. I look forward to doing even bigger things next.

## Improvements-needed

* I noticed that when I would open the same pages on my Home PC the pages would have empty white space before the border, the background would not cover everything. I plan on fixing that once i learn how to adjust the views on different systems.

* The page is pretty simple and static, in the future I would like to make the website more interactive, and colorful.

* I feel that there is too much blank space in all three pages and so I would like to add something on the sides of the main content.

## Reocurring-Errors

* I adjusted all of the dimensions and positions of the contents and images based on my laptop, and so opening them on bigger or smaller screens would ruin the set up of the page.

* When trying to possition the images of the portfolio it would also move the image of the about me page. I could not find a way to fix that using the same stylesheet for all three pages and so the way that I fixed it was adding a second stylesheet that was only linked to the portfolio html.

* Most of the time when I would try to style a specific element, for example the text in the about me page, I noticed that nothing would change no matter what I was changing. The problem would usually be that I was misspelling a class or id, or thinking it was a class when infact I had given them an id. I need to learn to check what I am writing because one wrong letter and the code will not work.

* Trying to recreate a webpage from just a image that is a smaller size, I couldnt get the exact meassurements. I would just use the inspect option on my webpage and try to get it as close as I thought it should be based on the images provided.

* I think that I did not structure my stylesheet correctly, it does not go down in order from the headder to the footer. I was just adding css as I would think of something that would work. I do not know if I repeated anything of added unnecessary codes.

## Resources

* I used google images for all the images used in the portfolio.

* Google was very useful, When ever I needed a reminder of how to possition something I would google how to do it.

* The inspect option on my websites was a great way to move stuff in the websites without having to write and errase my code every time i wanted to do something.

## Appreciations

* Thank you to whoever took the time to go through my pages and codes. I was not fully sure on how to write a readme.md file and so I did my best to go through the things I thought would be useful to know.
